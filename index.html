        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I'm an avid cyclist. On the weekends, you'll find me on long road or mountain bike rides, usually exploring something new.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I also played basketball. I'll happily tune into a game if it's on at a restaurant or catch up on the day's games with the Inside the NBA crew.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>MS Computer Science</h4>
          <h5>University of San Fransisco</h5>
          <p>As a student with a non-STEM major in undergrad, I was admitted to the Bridge program to help build my foundations in Computer Science before continuing with the regular Master's program.</p>
          <p>During the Master's program, I chose a variety of elective classes. These included Human Computer Interface, Machine Learning, Web Development, and System's Foundations. </p>

          <h4>BS Psychology: Behavioral Neuroscience</h4>
          <h5>Saint Mary's College of California</h5>
          <p>My favorite class at St. Mary's was called Experimental Psychology. The class taught experimental design, with some considerations specific to psychological experiemnts. Unfortunately this class, and my second semester at St. Mary's was interrupted my the COVID19 pandemic.</p>
